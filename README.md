# Topic Modeling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
This is a data analysis project that uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to perform topic modeling on a dataset of tweets about airline experiences. The goal of this project is to identify the most prevalent topics in the dataset and gain insights into the sentiment and trends within the airline industry.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Twitter US Airline Sentiment dataset, which consists of approximately 14,000 tweets about airline experiences across several major US airlines. The dataset has been preprocessed and cleaned for use in this project.

# Code
The code for this project is written in Python 3 and is contained in the TopicModeling.ipynb Jupyter notebook. The notebook uses the gensim library for implementing the LDA algorithm and the pyLDAvis library for visualizing the results.

The notebook is divided into several sections, including data loading and preprocessing, LDA model training, and topic visualization. Each section includes detailed explanations of the code and its functionality.

# Results
The results of the topic modeling are presented in the notebook using interactive visualizations generated with the pyLDAvis library. These visualizations allow for exploration of the topics and their relationships in a user-friendly way.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of LDA for topic modeling on a dataset of tweets about airline experiences and provides insights into the most prevalent topics and sentiment within the airline industry. The code and results can be easily replicated or modified for use in other text analysis projects.
